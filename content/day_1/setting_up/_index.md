There are two basic things you need to do in order to contribute[^1] to an open-source
Python project:

 1. Get the source code (`git` + remote hosts like [GitHub][gh] or [GitLab][gl]).
 2. Set up a development environment

[^1]: At least for creating PRs - a development environment is not strictly necessary to
      open an issue or perform a code review, though it is helpful for non-trivial
      changes.
