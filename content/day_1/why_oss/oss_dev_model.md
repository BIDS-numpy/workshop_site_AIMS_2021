Scientific research depends on the effective **communication** of new ideas,
methods, and results.
Other researchers must be able to understand your ideas and **reproduce** your
results in order to critique and expand upon your work.
The open source development model, based on **distributed version control**
(like `git`) and **permissive licenses** guarantee that everyone has
equal access to others' work and can verify and build upon it without
limitation.

More and more, modern research involves the development of software to
implement and explore new ideas.
The practices used to make software readable, usable, and accessible by all
overlap nicely with the requirements for modern, data-driven research.
