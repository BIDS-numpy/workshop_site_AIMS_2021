### Day 1

# Introduction & Getting Started

For the first day of the workshop, we will:
 - Motivate why open-source development practices are important for scientific research!
 - We will learn:
   * how scientific Python projects are structured
   * about two important features of every open-source project:
     **documentation** and **tests**.
   * how to navigate the project source code
   * how to interact with open-source packages with `git` and GitHub.
 - Meet developers of popular open-source scientific Python packages like
   `numpy`, `networkx`, and `scikit-image`!
