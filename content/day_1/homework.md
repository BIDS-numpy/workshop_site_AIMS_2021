Now it's your turn!
We've layed out the basics of how to get the source code and spin up a
working development environment, but like most things --- the devil is in the
details :smile:.
In preparation for tomorrow, I'd like you to **pick a Python package** and
**try setting up a development environment**!

You can choose whichever package you'd like - I'd recommend maybe choosing
one that you use often (e.g. `numpy`) or one that deals with an area you're
interested in (e.g. if you like image processing, try `scikit-image`).
Generally, I'd like for you to:

 1. Pick a project
 2. Find the "contributor guide" or "developer guide" for the
    project you've chosen - all projects should have something like this and
    it is generally a great place to start when trying to contribute to a
    project for the first time. Read through this document!
 3. Fork the project (if you haven't done so already)
 4. Clone your fork to get a local copy
 5. [Set up a development environment]({{< ref "/day_1/setting_up/dev_env_setup" >}})
    and run the test suite.
 6. **Bonus**: Try to build the project documentation locally.

**You are expected to have difficulties!**
What makes this a *workshop* instead of a *tutorial* is that we will have
mentors available tomorrow to help work through the problems you encounter!
Giving this a try on your own (or working in pairs if you prefer) beforehand will help
you get the most out of tomorrow!
