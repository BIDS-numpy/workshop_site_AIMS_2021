### A bit about me

My name is Ross [(@rossbar on GitHub)](https://github.com/rossbar).

I work at the [Berekeley Institute for Data Science](https://bids.berkeley.edu)
as a scientific software developer working primarily on projects like
[NetworkX](https://networkx.org) and [NumPy](https://numpy.org).
