My background is in nuclear engineering, specifically radiation
instrumentation --- devices to measure and create images of sources of
radiation.
The type of 3D radiation imaging that I studied has applications in
environmental monitoring:

As well as medical imaging:

This research was entirely made possible by **open-source software**.
Specifically, my colleagues and I relied heavily on various open-source
packages like [rgbdslam](https://github.com/felixendres/rgbdslam_v2) and
[Google Cartographer](https://google-cartographer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
to explore integrating our radiation imaging hardware with real-time SLAM
algorithms.

The second component that was instrumental in my research was scientific
Python software!
