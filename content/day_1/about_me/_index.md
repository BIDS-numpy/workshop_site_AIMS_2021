My name is Ross [(@rossbar on GitHub)](https://github.com/rossbar).

I work at the [Berekeley Institute for Data Science](https://bids.berkeley.edu)
as a scientific software developer working primarily on scientific Python
projects like [NetworkX](https://networkx.org) and [NumPy](https://numpy.org).

I've had the privilege of meeting & working with some of the previous AMMI
cohorts:
 - In 2019, we had a fun discussion on scientific Python and applictions in
   medical imaging.
 - In 2020, we held a [virtual NumPy workshop][aims-np] - feel free to check
   that out!
