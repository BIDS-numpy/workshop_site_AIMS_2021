This site is dedicated to the organization of the scientific Python new
contributors workshop, hosted virtually on **June 3rd-4th 2021** for the
2021 cohort of AMMI students.
The goal of this workshop is to connect AMMI students with developers of
open source software packages commonly used in their research.
Developers from some popular scientific software packages like
[NumPy](https://numpy.org/), [NetworkX](https://networkx.org/),
and [scikit-image](https://scikit-image.org/) will introduce their projects,
and provide students a behind-the-scenes look at how these packages are
developed.
The workshop will conclude with a **mentored sprint**.
